# Bitburner
My scripts ... some are WIP ... for the game Bitburner: https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/

For Github, the file-extensions were changed to .js - this gives better readability. For use in the game change the file-extension back to .script.

Scripts:
0:  Nukes the 0-Port Servers and starts a hack-script on these
1:  Maps all servers in a file for Script #2
2:  Scans the ServerMap for hackable servers and nukes these.
    The _hack_me.script gets installed
    The best hackable server is stored for further reference
3:  not in use anymore ... run script #9 instead
4:  tail the output of this script to observe the stats of the best target server
5:  buy personal servers
    - by best for available bucks
    - or upgrade existing pservers to highest RAM with available bucks
6:  Update existing pservers with hacking scripts and best TargetServer
9:  starts a hacking script on home on best TargetServer

# Bitburner
My scripts ... they are WIP but work ... for the game Bitburner: https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/

For Github, the file-extensions were changed to .js - this gives better readability. For use in the game change the file-extension back to .ns

### 27th of April 2019 ... NetScript 1 scripts were moved into subfolder ns1
Use the extension .script instead of .js there


###Scripts:

0:  Nukes the 0-Port Servers and starts a hack-script on these

1:  Maps all servers in a file for Script #2

2:  Scans the ServerMap for hackable servers and nukes these.
    
    The best hackable server is stored for further reference
    
    run script #7 afterwards
    
4:  tail the output of this script to observe the stats of the best target server

5:  buy personal servers

    - by best for available bucks
    
    - or upgrade existing pservers to highest RAM with available bucks
    
    - installs hacking-scripts
    
6:  Update existing pservers with hacking scripts and best TargetServer

7:  Scans all nuked servers and installs the target-server to be constantly weakened

9:  starts a hacking script on home on best TargetServer
